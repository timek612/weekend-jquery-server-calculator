## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This is just a really basic calculator web app. All of the logic is done server side and all of the information is stored on the server. There weren't any problems that I was stuck on more than others really, but one thing I'm really proud of was my ability to problem solve. When I thought I was stuck, I always found a way through the issue.
